# The Fabric Decision Web: Making Implementation Choices That Match Your Organization

## Abstract

Most Fabric implementations force six critical decisions: capacity organization, workspace topology, data architecture, user enablement, COE structure, and governance approach. The challenge? Not only do these decisions lack universal answers, but some lock you in while others can evolve as you learn.

This session helps you navigate implementation choices by exploring what each decision depends on and which ones are hardest to change later. Drawing on real-world examples, we'll examine common failures: IT teams applying infrastructure mental models to SaaS governance, BI teams building source-driven architectures that prevent integration, organizations paralyzed by trying to get everything perfect upfront.

You'll learn to identify where your organization sits on the Business-IT spectrum, match patterns to your context, and distinguish between decisions that need careful planning (capacity topology, workspace boundaries) versus those you should iterate (enablement approaches, governance policies). Whether starting fresh or untangling existing deployments, you'll leave knowing how to make coherent choices and adapt them as your implementation matures.
